Define your build machine via MACHINE, either in conf/local.conf or command-line.
i.e. 
MACHINE=p1025twr bitbake -k world

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-lsb
    core-image-sato
    -c populate_sdk core-image-minimal

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
